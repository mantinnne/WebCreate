        <h1>Antoine de Saint Exup√©ry - The little prince</h1>

        <p>TO LEON WERTH</p>

        <p>I ask the indulgence of the children who may read this book for dedicating it to a grown-up. I have a serious
            reason: he is the best friend I have in the world. I have another reason: this grown-up understands
            everything,
            even books about children. I have a third reason: he lives in France where he is hungry and cold. He needs
            cheering up. If all these reasons are not enough, I will dedicate the book to the child from whom this
            grown-up
            grew. All grown-ups were once children - although few of them remember it. And so I correct my dedication:

        <h1>I</h1>
        <p>Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called <span class="text">True Stories from Nature</span>,
            about the primeval forest. It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal. Here is
            a
            copy of the drawing.</p>

        <img src="http://users.uoa.gr/~nektar/arts/tributes/antoine_de_saint-exupery_le_petit_prince/images/hroznys.jpg"
            alt="">

        <p>In the book it said: <span class="text">Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it. After that they are
            notable to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion.</span></p>
        <p>I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some work with a colored pencil I
            succeeded
            in making my first drawing. My Drawing Number One. It looked something like this:</p>
        <img src="http://users.uoa.gr/~nektar/arts/tributes/antoine_de_saint-exupery_le_petit_prince/images/klobouk.jpg"
            alt="">

        <p>I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the drawing frightened themn.</p>
        <p>But they answered: <span class="text">"Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?"</span></p>
        <p>My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant. But since
            the
            grown-ups were not able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of a boa constrictor, so
            that the grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need to have things explained. My Drawing Number Two
            looked
            like this:</p>
        <img src="http://users.uoa.gr/~nektar/arts/tributes/antoine_de_saint-exupery_le_petit_prince/images/slon.jpg"
            alt="">

        <p>The grown-ups' response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors, whether
            from
            the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar. That is
            why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter. I had been
            disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two. Grown-ups never understand
            anything by themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them.
        </p>
        <p>So then I chose another profession, and learned to pilot airplanes. I have flown a little over all parts of
            the
            world; and it is true that geography has been very useful to me. At a glance I can distinguish China from
            Arizona. If one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is valuable.</p>
        <p>In the course of this life I have had a great many encounters with a great many people who have been
            concerned
            with matters of consequence. I have lived a great deal among grown-ups. I have seen them intimately, close
            at
            hand. And that hasn't much improved my opinion of them.</p>
        <p>Whenever I met one of them who seemed to me at all clear-sighted, I tried the experiment of showing him my
            Drawing Number One, which I have always kept. I would try to find out, so, if this was a person of true
            understanding. But, whoever it was, he, or she, would always say:</p>
        <p>"<span class="text">That is a hat</span>."</p>
        <p>Then I would never talk to that person about boa constrictors, or primeval forests, or stars. I would bring
            myself down to his level. I would talk to him about bridge, and golf, and politics, and neckties. And the
            grown-up would be greatly pleased to have met such a sensible man.</p>
